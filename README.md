# Bus-Project
## This project uses an API from mapbox to create a map that notes each bus stop from Harvard University to MIT University
# How to Run
## To run this code, you'll have clone this git and sign up for a mapbox account, which will give you a token and replace line 18 with your token. Once you do that, you can run the script and click the button to make the map note the bus stops
# Roadmap of Future Improvements
## I'd like to create a similar map, but for something more relevant to me and others by me. For example, I think it would be fun to create a map that highlights a bar crawl around NYC showing the stops
